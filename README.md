# API Documentation with HTML

Open index.html and you can see an overview of all your API routes and what they do.
The default file is just a template and an example.

## How to make your own documentation

Simply edit the index.html file and fill in the information 
 You can copy paste the routes to add your own. To do so copy everything between `<!-- PATH -->` and `<!-- PATH -END -->`
For complete customization you can also edit the index.css file, but in general its not needed to be touched.
